#6- Parameterization
    - What is Parameterization?
    - Parameterization is being able to pass and change data directly from feature file.
    - We don't have to go in the step definitions to change the data when we use Parameterization.

- What is the difference between Parameterization and datatables?

#7- dataTables
    - We can pass COLLECTIONS TYPE OF DATA under the same STEP.
        - LIST
        - MAP
        - LIST OF MAP
        - MAP OF MAP

- What is the difference between Parameterization and Scenario outlines?

#8- scenario outlines
    - Scenario outlines allows us to simplify the DDT (Data Driven Testing) by creating "Example:" tables under our "Scenario Outline:""

    - We don't have to come to feature file to change the data everytime we run. We only provide once, and our scenario will be executed against all of this data.

    - Whereas, in parameterization, we would have to come back to change all the data just to run the same scenario with another test data.
